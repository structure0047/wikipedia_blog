                     died March 23, 1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]) was a revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.
                     Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of modern Hinduism), and then
                     National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in India while still a youth  and soon fought for national 
                     independence. He also worked as a writer and editor in  Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories.
                     He is credited with popularizing the catchphrase ‚ÄúInquilab zindabad‚Äù (‚ÄúLong live the revolution‚Äù).
                     In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others  to kill the police chief  responsible for the death of Indian  writer and politician  Lala 
                     Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of  National College,  during a silent  march opposing  the Simon  Commission. Instead, in a case of 
                     mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929
                     he and an associate lobbed a bomb at the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India 
                     Act and then surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.

                     Allahabad) was an Indian revolutionary who organized and led a band of militant youth during India‚Äôs independence movement. Azad was
                     drawn into the Indian national movement at a young age. When apprehended by the  police at age 15 while participating in Mohandas K. 
                     Gandhi‚Äôs noncooperation movement (1920‚Äì22) at Banares (now Varanasi), he gave his name as Azad (Urdu: ‚ÄúFree‚Äù or ‚ÄúLiberated‚Äù) and his 
                     address as ‚Äúprison.‚Äù  Although because of his age he was not  imprisoned, he was given a severe   flogging by the police. The Indian
                     National Congress (Congress Party) soon lionized him, and he gained popularity among the Indian people.
                     Azad was disappointed by Gandhi‚Äôs  suspension of the  noncooperation  movement  in February 1922,  after several  policemen had been 
                     murdered by a revolutionary mob at Chauri Chaura. Joining the radical Hindustan  Republican Association  (HRA), Azad participated in
                     several violent crimes, notably the Kakori train robbery (1925) and the revenge killing of a British police officer (1928).
                     Known for his organizational skills, Azad played a key role in reorganizing  the HRA as the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association
                     after most of the HRA‚Äôs  members had been killed or  imprisoned. His crimes had made him a wanted man, but Azad  was able to elude the
                     police and its informants for several years. According to Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs autobiography, it was during this  period of  underground
                     existence that Azad met Nehru in early 1931 to enquire  whether‚Äîunder the discussions  being held  that resulted in the signing of the 
                     Gandhi-Irwin Pact in March‚Äîthe revolutionaries could expect a fair deal leading to their honourable rehabilitation.

                     Tashkent,Uzbekistan, U.S.S.R.) was an Indian statesman, prime minister of India (1964‚Äì66) after Jawaharlal Nehru.
                     A member of Mahatma Gandhi‚Äôs noncooperation movement against British government in India, he was imprisoned for a short time (1921).
                     Upon release he studied in the Kashi Vidyapitha, a nationalist university, where he graduated with the title of shastri (‚Äúlearned in
                     the scriptures‚Äù). He then returned to politics as a follower of Gandhi, was imprisoned  several more times, and attained influential
                     positions in the Congress Party of the state of the United Provinces, now Uttar Pradesh state.
                     Shastri was elected to the legislature of the United Provinces in 1937 and 1946. After Indian independence, Shastri gained experien-

                     union minister for railways and transport. He gained a reputation as a skillful  mediator after his   appointment to the influential
                     post of minister for home affairs in 1961. Three years later, on Jawaharlal Nehru‚Äôs illness, Shastri was appointed minister  without
                     portfolio, and after Nehru‚Äôs death he became prime minister in June 1964.
                     Shastri was criticized for failing to deal effectively with India‚Äôs economic problems,but he won great popularity for his firmness on 
                     the outbreak of hostilities with neighbouring Pakistan(1965)over the disputed Kashmir region. He died of a heart attack after signing 
                     a ‚Äúno-war‚Äù agreement with Pres. Ayub Khan of Pakistan and was succeeded as prime minister by Indira Gandhi, Nehru‚Äôs daughter.

                     was the first prime minister of independent India (1947‚Äì64), who established parliamentary government and became noted for his neutral-
                     -ist (nonaligned) policies in foreign affairs. He was also one of the principal leaders of the Indian Independence Movement during the 
                     1930s and ‚Äô40s.Early years Nehru was  born to a family of Kashmiri  Brahmans, noted for  their administrative aptitude and scholarship,
                     who had migrated to Delhi early in the 18th century. He was a  son of Motilal Nehru, a renowned  lawyer and leader of the Indian indep-
                     -endence movement, who became one of Mohandas (Mahatma) Gandhi‚Äôs prominent associates. Jawaharlal was the eldest of four children, two
                     of whom were girls. A sister, Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit, later became the first woman president of the United Nations General Assembly.
                     Until the age of 16, Nehru was educated at home by a series of English governesses  and tutors.  Only one of  those‚Äîa part-Irish, part-
                     Belgian  theosophist, Ferdinand  Brooks‚Äîappears to  have made any  impression  on him. Jawaharlal also had a venerable Indian tutor who 
                     taught him Hindi and Sanskrit. In 1905 he went to Harrow, a leading English school,  where he stayed  for two years.  Nehru‚Äôs  academic 
                     career was in no way outstanding.  From Harrow he went to  Trinity College, Cambridge,  where he spent  three years earning  an honours 
                     degree in natural science. On leaving  Cambridge he qualified as a barrister  after two years at the Inner Temple, London, where in his
                     own words he passed his examinations ‚Äúwith neither glory nor ignominy.‚Äù

                           Princeton, New Jersey, U.S.) was a German-born physicist who developed the special  and general theories of relativity and won 
                           the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1921 for his explanation of the photoelectric effect. Einstein is generally considered the most 
                           influential physicist of the 20th century.(Read Einstein‚Äôs 1926 Britannica essay on space-time.)
                           Childhood and education Einstein‚Äôs parents were secular, middle-class Jews. His father, Hermann Einstein, was originally a fe-
                           -atherbed salesman and later ran an electrochemical factory with moderate success. His mother, the former Pauline Koch, ran
                           the family household. He had one sister, Maria (who went by the name Maja), born two years after Albert.
                           Einstein would write that two ‚Äúwonders‚Äù deeply affected his early years. The first was his encounter with a compass at age five.
                           He was mystified that invisible forces could deflect the needle.This would lead to a lifelong fascination with invisible forces.
                           The second wonder came at age 12 when he discovered a book of geometry, which he devoured,calling it his ‚Äúsacred little geometry
                           book.‚Äù Einstein became deeply religious at age 12, even composing several songs in praise of God and chanting religious songs on 
                           the way to school. This began to change,however, after he read science books that contradicted his religious beliefs. This chal-
                           -lenge to established authority left a deep and lasting impression. At the Luitpold Gymnasium,  Einstein often felt out of place 
                           and victimized by a  Prussian-style educational system  that seemed to stifle originality and creativity.  One teacher even told 
                           him that he would never amount to anything.

                           7,1943,New York, New York, U.S.) was a Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating magnetic 
                           field,the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of electric power transmission.
                           He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his system of alternating-current dynamos,transformers,
                           and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.
                           Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother was unschooled but highly intelligent.
                           As he matured, he displayed remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic touch.
                           Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, Austria,and the University of Prague. At Graz
                           he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when reversed, became an  electric motor, and he conceived a
                           way to use alternating current to advantage. Later, at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and 
                           developed plans for an induction motor that would become his first step toward the successful utilization of alternating current.
                           In 1882 Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while on  assignment to Strassburg in 1883, he cons-
                           -tructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed for America in 1884, arriving in New York with four cents in
                           his pocket, a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying machine. He first found employment with Thomas Edison, but the
                           two inventors were far apart in background and methods, and their separation was inevitable.

                           Lincolnshire, England‚Äîdied March 20 [March 31], 1727, London) was an English physicist and mathematician who was the culminating
                           figure of the Scientific Revolution of the 17th century. In optics, his  discovery of the  composition of white light integrated 
                           the phenomena of colours into the science of light and  laid the foundation for modern physical optics.  In mechanics, his three 
                           laws of motion, the basic principles of modern physics, resulted in the formulation of the law of universal gravitation. 
                           In mathematics, he was the original discoverer of the infinitesimal calculus. Newton‚Äôs Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathema-
                           -tica (Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy, 1687) was one of the most important single  works in the history of modern 
                           science.Formative influences Born in the hamlet of Woolsthorpe, Newton was the only son of a local yeoman, also Isaac Newton, 
                           who had died three months before, and of Hannah Ayscough. That same year, at Arcetri near Florence, Galileo Galilei had died;
                           Newton would eventually pick up his idea of a mathematical science of motion and bring his work to full fruition. A tiny and weak
                           baby, Newton was not expected to survive his first day of life, much less 84 years. Deprived of a    father before birth, he soon 
                           lost his mother as well,for within two years she married a second time; her husband, the well-to-do minister Barnabas Smith, left
                           young Isaac with his grandmother and moved to a neighbouring village to raise a son and two daughters.  For nine years, until the
                           death of Barnabas Smith in 1653, Isaac was  effectively separated from his mother, and his  pronounced psychotic  tendencies have
                           been ascribed to this traumatic event.

                           his impoverished circumstances. He earned a degree in aeronautical  engineering from the  Madras Institute of Technology and 
                           in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation  (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian  Space Research Or- 
                           -ganisation (ISRO), where he was project director of the SLV-III, the  first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed 
                           and produced in India. In 1980 SLV-III successfully released a satellite called Rohini into near-Earth orbit, taking India‚Äôs

   Rosalind Franklin
   Main article: Rosalind Franklin (rover)
   Rosalind Franklin,[7] previously known as the ExoMars rover, is a planned robotic Mars rover, part of the international 
   ExoMars programme led by the European Space Agency and the Russian Roscosmos State Corporation.[8][9]
   
   Initially scheduled to launch in July 2020, but has since been delayed due to testing issues with the rover's landing 
   mechanism. As of May 2022, the launch of the rover is not expected to occur before 2028 due to the need for a new non
   -Russian landing platform.[10] Once safely landed, the solar powered rover will begin a seven-month (218-sol) mission 
   to search for the existence of past life on Mars. The Trace Gas Orbiter (TGO), launched in 2016, will operate as 
   Rosalind Franklin's and lander's data-relay satellite.[11]

   Main article: Mars Orbiter Mission 2
   Mars Orbiter Mission 2 (MOM 2), also called Mangalyaan-2, is India's second interplanetary mission planned for launch 
   to Mars by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). As per some reports emerged, the mission was to be an orbiter 
   to Mars proposed for 2024.[12] However, in a recorded interview in October 2019, VSSC director has indicated the 
   inclusion of a lander and rover.[13] The orbiter will use aerobraking to lower its initial apoapsis and enter into an 
   orbit more suitable for observations.[14][15][16]
   
   Asteroids
   Main article: Exploration of the asteroids
   An article in science magazine Nature suggested the use of asteroids as a gateway for space exploration, with the 
   ultimate destination being Mars. In order to make such an approach viable, three requirements need to be fulfilled: 
   first, "a thorough asteroid survey to find thousands of nearby bodies suitable for astronauts to visit"; second, 
   "extending flight duration and distance capability to ever-increasing ranges out to Mars"; and finally, "developing 
   better robotic vehicles and tools to enable astronauts to explore an asteroid regardless of its size, shape or spin.
   " Furthermore, using asteroids would provide astronauts with protection from galactic cosmic rays, with mission 
   crews being able to land on them without great risk to radiation exposure.<br><br>

   Breakthrough Enceladus
   Main article: Breakthrough Enceladus mission
   Breakthrough Enceladus is an astrobiology space probe mission concept to explore the possibility of life on Saturn's 
   moon, Enceladus.[17] In September 2018, NASA signed a collaboration agreement with Breakthrough to jointly create 
   the mission concept.[18] This mission would be the first privately funded deep space mission.[19] It would study 
   the content of the plumes ejecting from Enceladus's warm ocean through its southern ice crust.[20] Enceladus's 
   ice crust is thought to be around two to five kilometers thick,[21] and a probe could use an ice-penetrating 
   radar to constrain its structure.[22]
   
   Space telescopes
   PLATO
   Main article: PLATO
   Planetary Transits and Oscillations of Stars (PLATO) is a space telescope under development by the European Space Agency
   for launch in 2026.[23] The mission goals are to search for planetary transits across up to one million stars, and to 
   discover and characterize rocky extrasolar planets around yellow dwarf stars (like the Sun), subgiant stars, and red 
   dwarf stars. The emphasis of the mission is on Earth-like planets in the habitable zone around Sun-like stars where
   water can exist in liquid state.[24] It is the third medium-class mission in ESA's Cosmic Vision programme and 
   named after the influential Greek philosopher Plato, the founding figure of Western philosophy, science and 
   mathematics. A secondary objective of the mission is to study stellar oscillations or seismic activity in 
   stars to measure stellar masses and evolution and enabling the precise characterization of the planet 
   host star, including its age.[25]

   Crewed missions
   SpaceX Starship
   Main article: SpaceX Starship
   The SpaceX Starship is planned to be a spacecraft launched as the second stage of a reusable launch vehicle. 
   The concept is under development by SpaceX, as a private spaceflight project.[26] It is being designed to be 
   a long-duration cargo- and passenger-carrying spacecraft.[27] While it will be tested on its own initially, 
   it will be used on orbital launches with an additional booster stage, the Super Heavy, where Starship would 
   serve as the second stage on a two-stage-to-orbit launch vehicle.[28] The combination of spacecraft and booster 
   is called Starship as well.[29]
   
   Boeing Starliner 1
   Main article: Boeing Starliner 1
   The Boeing Starliner 1 mission will be the first operational crewed mission of the Boeing Starliner and the first 
   mission to reuse the Starliner Spacecraft. The mission is expected to launch no earlier than December 2021 using 
   the Atlas V rocket with a crew of four astronauts, three NASA astronauts and likely one international partner 
   astronaut from either Japan, Canada, or the European Space Agency. This mission will be the fourth US spaceflight 
   with a female commander.
   
   Gaganyaan
   Main article: Gaganyaan
   ISRO's future Gaganyaan mission, which is the first Indian Human Spaceflight Programme, comprises a crew module 
   which is a fully autonomous 5.3-tonne (12,000 lb) spacecraft designed to carry a 3-member crew to orbit and safely 
   return to the Earth after a mission duration of up to seven days. Its 2.9-tonne (6,400 lb) service module is powered 
   by liquid propellant engines. It is to be launched on the GSLV Mk III launcher no earlier than 2022. About 16 minutes 
   after liftoff from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC), Sriharikota, the rocket will inject the spacecraft into an 
   orbit 300‚Äì400 km (190‚Äì250 mi) above Earth. When ready to land, its service module and solar panels will be disposed 
   off before reentry. The capsule would return for a parachute splashdown in the Bay of Bengal.
   
   Limitations with deep space exploration
   The future possibilities for deep space exploration are limited by a set of technical, practical, astronomical, and 
   human limitations, which define the future of crewed and uncrewed space exploration. As of 2022, the farthest any 
   human-made probe has traveled is the current NASA mission Voyager 1,[30] 23.61 billion km (14.67 billion mi), around 
   157.8 AU, from Earth, while the nearest star is around 4.24 light years away, that is the equivalent of 268142.2 AU.
   
   Technical limitations
   The current status of space-faring technology, including propulsion systems, navigation, resources and storage all
    present limitations to the development of human space exploration in the near future.
   
   Distances
   The astronomical order of magnitude of the distance between Earth and the nearest stars is a challenge for the current 
   development of space exploration. At the current top speed of 70.2 km/s, the Helios 2 probe would arrive at the nearest 
   star, Proxima Centauri, in around 18,000 years,[31] much longer than a human lifespan and therefore requiring much faster 
   transportation methods than currently available. This top speed was achieved due to the Oberth effect where the spacecraft 
   was sped up by a combination of the Sun's gravity and its own propulsion system. The fastest escape velocity from the Solar 
   System is that of Voyager 1 at 17 km/s.<br><br>

   Propulsion and fuel
   
   The VASIMR plasma based propulsion engine[32]
   In terms of propulsion, the main challenge is the liftoff and initial momentum, since there is no friction in the vacuum of 
   space. Based on the missions goals, including factors such as distance, load and time of flight, the type of propulsion 
   drive used, planned to use, or in design varies from chemical propellants, such as liquid hydrogen and oxidizer[33] 
   (Space Shuttle Main Engine), to plasma[32] or even nanoparticle propellants.[34] Another propulsion system that 
   may be used is ion propulsion.
   
   
   Project Longshot Nuclear Fission Engine schematic
   As for future developments, the theoretical possibilities of nuclear based propulsion have been analyzed over 60 years ago, 
   such as nuclear fusion (Project Daedalus) and nuclear pulse propulsion (Project Longshot),[35] but have since been 
   discontinued from practical research by NASA. On the more speculative side, the theoretical Alcubierre drive presents a 
   mathematical solution for ‚Äúfaster-than-light‚Äù travel, but it would require the mass-Energy of Jupiter, not to mention the 
   technical issues.[36]
   
   Human limitations
   The human element in crewed space exploration adds certain physiological and psychological issues and limitations to the 
   future possibilities of space exploration, along with storage and sustenance space and mass issues.
   
   Physiological issues
   The transitioning gravity magnitudes on the body is detrimental to orientation, coordination, and balance. Without 
   constant gravity, bones suffer disuse osteoporosis, and their mineral density falls 12 times faster than the average 
   elderly adult's.[37] Without regular exercise and nourishment, there can be cardiovascular deterioration and loss in 
   muscle strength.[38] Dehydration can cause kidney stones,[39] and constant hydro-static potential in zero-g can shift 
   body fluids upwards and cause vision problems.[40]
   
   Furthermore, without Earth's surrounding magnetic field as a shield, solar radiation has much harsher effects on 
   biological organisms in space. The exposure can include damage to the central nervous system, (altered cognitive 
   function, reducing motor function and incurring possible behavioral changes), as well as the possibility of 
   degenerative tissue diseases.<br><br>
